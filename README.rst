About Galleriffic
=================

Galleriffic_ is a jQuery plugin that provides a rich, post-back free experience optimized to handle high volumes of photos while conserving bandwidth. I am not so great at spelling, and it was much later that I realized that the more appropriate spellings would be Gallerific or Gallerrific, but is too late now for a name change, so Galleriffic remains.

Galleriffic can integrate with the JQuery History plugin that already exists in Plone by using the addon collective.jqhistory.
